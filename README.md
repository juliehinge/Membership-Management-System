# Membership-Management-System



The Supermarket Membership Management Department consists of two main components for Membership 
Management System (MMS), an administrative component, and an MMS component. 
 
The administrative section allows, through text-based menus, the  login  and  logout of  administrators, the 
addition and removal of members in the system, the display of membership records, the display of a certain 
member with name, and the update of member’s accounts. 
 
The  MMS  component  stores  a  list  of  all  the  membership  information  of  the  members  and  a  list  of  the 
summary of the  membership. The  MMS component also allows  the creation and  display  of the  collective 
tuition report as MMS record log. Finally, the MMS component also handles the display of a certain member 
information. 
 
Each membership record includes the member’s ID, name, email, phone, address, type, credits, deduction 
rate, gas deduction rate, dollar available, pay per credits and supermarket fields.
